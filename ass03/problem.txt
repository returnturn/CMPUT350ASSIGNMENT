 CMPUT 350 Assignment 3
 Due Wednesday Oct. 30, 22:00
  
 The objective of this assignment is to produce a class that can store a
 map-like structure and perform pathfinding and connectivity operations on it

 Class Grid represents a rectangular tile map with octile topology, i.e. 8
 compass directions using Euclidean distance. There are blocked, ground, or
 water tiles. Moving objects are not represented in the grid

 The moving object for pathfinding has a location x,y and size s.  It is
 considered to occupy the tiles from x to x+s in the x-axis, and from y to y+s
 in the y-axis. Thus, an object with size 0 occupies one tile, and object with
 size 1 occupies a 2x2 square, and an object with size 2 occupies a 3x3
 square. You are only required to support objects of sizes 0,1, and 2

 Moves are permitted if and only if all tiles passed through during the move
 have the same tile type. For instance, if a 3x3 object is on ground tiles, it
 may only move diagonally if the 4x4 region it passes over is composed solely
 of ground tiles

 Similarly, a 2x2 object on water tiles may move to the east if the 3x2 region
 it passes over is composed entirely of water tiles

 Example:

   01234

 0 wwggg   A 3x3 object centered in this 5x5 map may move west, south, or
 1 ggggg   southwest, because it will pass only over ground tiles. However,
 2 ggggg   it may NOT move northeast, even though it would wind up on a 3x3
 3 ggggw   patch of ground tiles, because it would clip through some water
 4 ggggw   tiles when moving

 Note that in the above example, the object's initial location would be (1,1)
 and its size would be 2, meaning it occupies from 1 to 3 on both the x and y
 axises

 To test your implementation issue make which creates testGrid. See
 TestGrid.cpp for documentation

 exampleGrid is our solution that should run on lab machines


 Submission and Marking
 ----------------------
 
 Submit your solution 
  
   README.txt GridPriv.h GridInclude.h Grid.cpp

 via eClass
 
 Your submissions will be marked considering their correctness (syntax +
 semantics), documentation, efficiency, and coding style. Add assert
 statements to check important pre/post-conditions, use all warning options
 (-Wall -Wextra -g -O). Your code must compile without warning or error
 messages on the lab machines. You may use any C/C++ standard libraries you
 want, such as STL, and Boost. Feel free to use C++17 features that g++ on the
 lab computers support. We will compile your code using -std=c++17

 Do not include a main() function in your submitted code. When testing, define
 your main() function in a separate .cpp file and link with the corresponding
 .o file

 Also, private class members you might want to add to class Grid must be
 defined in file GridPriv.h, which you will submit together with Grid.cpp

 Finally, before submitting all files complete the README.txt file
